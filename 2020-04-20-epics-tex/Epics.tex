\section*{Bottom Line Up Front}

\emph{Communicate K3 software development plans and progress using \emph{Releases} and \emph{Epics} instead of using only \emph{Stories}.}




%Epics

%BLUF
%Communicate K3 software development plans and progress using Releases and Epics instead of using only Stories.

%My experience in IIS
%1 Release every 18 months
%Release contained 8-10 Features
%Feature is specified as an Epic
%Example
%Release 9.5
%Cloud Cover Pct on videos
%File formats
%Data providers
%OS upgrade
%Quarterly traffic report
%Last 3-week interval before release is an Integration period
%No stories
%Merging
%Integration testing
%Bug fixes
%Documents
%Reviews and release procedures
%Packaging
%Releases are calendar-based
%Epics are features delivered in a Release
%Atlassian documents
%https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics
%
%Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints. As a team learns more about an epic through development and customer feedback, user stories will be added and removed as necessary. Thatâ€™s the key with agile epics: Scope is flexible, based on customer feedback and team cadence.
%
%Releases and epics are communicated outside the group/sprint team
%Stories are not communicated to the customer or outside the group/sprint team
