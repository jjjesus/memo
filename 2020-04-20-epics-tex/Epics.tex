\section*{Bottom Line Up Front}

\emph{Communicate K3 software development plans and progress using \emph{Releases} and \emph{Epics} instead of using only \emph{Sprints and Stories}.}

\subsection*{Example for K3 Release}

I am guessing at the release name, date, and, the feature list based on looking at what's in the \emph{KSW} Jira backlog, but, here's an example for a supposed K3 software release.

\textbf{Release K3 1.0 --- July 1, 2020 --- Feature (Epic) List}
\begin{itemize}
[noitemsep]
\item X-ES Xpedite 7674 Board Support
\item Disable ssh access to radar
\item Change SSD encryption scheme
\item Change ABEU Boot
\item VLAN networking
\item Filtered logging
\item New software packaging for K3
\item Stand up integration lab environment for K3
\end{itemize}

The Sprint and Story information is something that only the Sprinting Team uses; not exposing Sprints and Stories is a way to protect the team's Agile ability. External stakeholders like the Customer, Program Office, and others, see only the Release and the Epics, as above

%Part of our Agile planning is coming up with a list of Stories that are required to fulfill each Feature/Epic.  We divide up the calendar into Sprint Intervals leading to the release date, and, we make a first-pass at distributing the Stories into each Sprint; we may find right away that our initial commitment of Features is too much, or, that some Epics are missing.

\section*{Background}
\subsection*{Using Releases and Epics at Raytheon IIS}

I inherited what I found to be a good Agile process at Raytheon IIS and found that communicating with external stakeholders (Customer, Program Office, and others) using Release and Epics instead of only Stories was useful and allowed the Sprinting team to protect its Agile ability.

\subsubsection*{Releases are calendar-based}
We had a release every 9-months and the content for each release was part of the contract. Each Release contained 8-10 \emph{Features}.  Here is what I remember about one of the releases (scrubbed to be unclassified):

\textbf{Release 9.5 --- July 1, 2018}
\begin{itemize}
[noitemsep]
\item Cloud Cover Percentage tag on videos
\item Support for new file format 1
\item Support for new file format 2
\item Support for new file format 3
\item Support for new data provider 1
\item Support for new data provider 2
\item Support for new data provider 3
\item OS Upgrade
\item New quarterly traffic reports and metrics
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Features stored in Jira as \emph{Epics}}

The release content was specified as \emph{Features} and we stored them in Jira as \emph{Epics}.
In other words, \emph{Epics are the Features delivered in a Release}.

\subsubsection*{Epics in Atlassian Jira}
Atlassian describes Epics on this web page: \href{https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics}{Atlassian web page}. Helpful excerpt:

\begin{quote}
Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints. As a team learns more about an epic through development and customer feedback, user stories will be added and removed as necessary. Thatâ€™s the key with agile epics: Scope is flexible, based on customer feedback and team cadence.
\end{quote}

Communicating with external stakeholders through Epics allows the development team to stay agile through adding and removing stories for each Epic as necessary.  The development team can report Progress, Estimate-To-Completion (ETC), and Estimate-At-Completion (EAC) against an Epic by deriving it from the Story Point information in Jira, but, Stories are not communicated to the customer or outside the group/sprint team.

\subsection*{Additional note: Last interval before Release}
One additional note is that the last 3-week interval before release is an Integration period. During this period, no Stories are planned.  Instead, the team goes into a Kanban mode (that is, creating a task list each day and working only on those tasks) among these activities:

\textbf{Integration Period Activities}
\begin{itemize}
[noitemsep]
\item Merging
\item Integration testing
\item Bug fixes
\item Documents
\item Reviews and release procedures
\item Packaging
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How to set this up in Jira}

Do these items immediately:

\begin{itemize}
[noitemsep]
\item Figure out a Release date; I think it's tied to Gelato.
\item Create the Epic list for the Release. Probably want Rob for this one.
\item Figure out how many Sprints we have until the Release date.  Try to leave room for a 3-week integration period immediately preceding the Release.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Do these items at or before the next Sprint Planning:

\begin{itemize}
[noitemsep]
\item Pick the Epics we want to attack in the Sprint.
\item Get the Story list right for each Epic for the Sprint.
\item After the Story list is done, estimate the Story points
\end{itemize}
